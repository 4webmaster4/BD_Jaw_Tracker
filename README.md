## Video source
Video can be recorded on any device with focus control. We used video Ultra HD 4K (3840 x 2160) 60fps, captured on iPhone X.

## Calibration
*Calibration done once, if you use only one camera and same focus distance.*

1. Print CalibrationBoard from ForPrinting directory. Stick it on flat surface of suitable size. 
2. Lock focus of your camera and remember its value.
3. Make seria of photos changing the position of the board.
4. Mesure with calipers width of single marker and width of single square. (Near 12.3 mm and 24.4 mm). Convert it to m (0.0123 m and 0.0244 m).
